TODO
handle sound files and not just video files.
Have some sort of prettyprint for a transcription. It can start the line with hour:minute:seconds- the words that come for that e.g. 10 seconds. Then new line with next words.

Build in test-example




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Webpage
Features:
- Install guide with videos/gifs
  - Images to right. Can I skip the layout? Set up reusable code blocks
  - Create changed theme to load? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create youtube video.
- Record real video
  - Create transcript
- Screen record workflow
- Edit video together

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create forum post
Make install instructions
- Docker
- open terminal
- drag & drop folder to open that path
- git, build docker
- run program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Would also work for podcasts

Voice commands
Debug commands - https://speechlogger.appspot.com/
- Recording assistant. Video helper
- Start/end clip
- Add mark(s) *name*. Adds video

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long term
- Workflow Extension - plugin for final cut. Seems like you have to collaborate with apple? Mac OS desktop client could allow for drag and drop workflow at least.
- Add full transcriptions?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
App
If I do an app it offers up a few possibilities. I can create a project within the app and from there create complicated tags that wont fit in a QR code - but they will be mapped to simple ints which do fit in QR - hopefully even miiini QR. Once the project is finilized you can export the mapping to the python program - json or maybe through a big QR code that you scan with webcam-ish?

App should also have option of just saving tags, without putting them into a QR and sync to video.

Pure post-processing options
Dictating speech seems very important but already has a few big players
Automatic tagging of video would be good. What tags to select?
Automatically detect scene-repeats (duplicates) would be useful. What about scenes which are similar but not duplicates? Could give a draft that can be edited
