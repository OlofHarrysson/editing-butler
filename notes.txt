TODO
Have some sort of prettyprint for a transcription. It can start the line with hour:minute:seconds- the words that come for that e.g. 10 seconds. Then new line with next words.

*start camera*

*enter pudgey*
butler stop clip

Hi there,
Today i'll show you how to use Butler. For those of you watching this video but aren't familiar with Butler, have a look at the link in the description for more information.

so

Butler helps to organize your videos through voice commands. These are the supported voice commands today
*show commands in edit*
Lets try adding a marker.

Butler add marker hungry

As you can see, using Butler is pretty simple. You don't need any tools apart from your normal recording equipment because the voice analyzis is performed at a later stage in the computer.

This unfortunately means that you won't get any confirmation that you were understood so it's important to pronounce the butler commands clearly.

The next feature I want to show you is the ability to create a virtual clip inside the video with the start and stop commands.

To start the virtual recording you simply say
butler start clip

In here
You can still add markers
Butler add marker virtual

And when we want to stop the clip

Butler stop clip.


That's all there's to it! The next step is to analyze the video. CyA!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
create new event
import videos
export xml
run butler on it
have it auto import
also do manual import
show the markers on the timeline
point out the keywords on the timeline
go into marker smart collections. search
go into keyword


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
show requirements
show docker website
open terminal

drag folder to where we want to install
clone git
build docker

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create forum post
Make install instructions
- Docker
- open terminal
- drag & drop folder to open that path
- git, build docker
- run program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Would also work for podcasts

Voice commands
Debug commands - https://speechlogger.appspot.com/
- Recording assistant. Video helper
- Start/end clip
- Add mark(s) *name*. Adds video

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long term
- Workflow Extension - plugin for final cut. Seems like you have to collaborate with apple? Mac OS desktop client could allow for drag and drop workflow at least.
- Add full transcriptions?
  - Highlight conversation - but not do the transcripts
- Create new events + asset clips. One for commands, one for speech one for etc. Would avoid polluting the original and clutter
- release patches, keep master stable and do development on develop


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
App
If I do an app it offers up a few possibilities. I can create a project within the app and from there create complicated tags that wont fit in a QR code - but they will be mapped to simple ints which do fit in QR - hopefully even miiini QR. Once the project is finilized you can export the mapping to the python program - json or maybe through a big QR code that you scan with webcam-ish?

App should also have option of just saving tags, without putting them into a QR and sync to video.

Pure post-processing options
Dictating speech seems very important but already has a few big players
Automatic tagging of video would be good. What tags to select?
Automatically detect scene-repeats (duplicates) would be useful. What about scenes which are similar but not duplicates? Could give a draft that can be edited
